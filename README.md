## Technical Details

### Lighting Configuration

**Arena Lighting:**
- Main directional light: 15% brightness (was 100%)
- Secondary upward light: 8% brightness
- Ambient lighting: 5% intensity
- Crowd area lighting: 2% intensity

**Preserved at 100%:**
- Car headlights (full brightness, range, and shadow casting)
- Boost trails (particles, glow, and light radius)
- Boost pads (glow intensity and pulse animation)
- Boost flames (dynamic lighting and shadows)

**Visibility Safeguards:**
- Ball ambient light: 40%
- Ball self-illumination: 20%
- Goal post lighting: 100%
- Field boundaries: 30% visibility

### Performance Impact

This mod actually **improves performance** on most systems by:
- Reducing the number of active light sources
- Optimizing lightmap calculations
- Disabling unnecessary ambient lighting

Expected FPS improvement: 5-15% on mid-range systems

## Customization

### Adjusting Darkness Level

Edit `LightsOut.upk` and modify these values:

```ini
[ArenaLighting]
DirectionalLight_Main_Brightness=0.15    ; Range: 0.10-0.30
AmbientLight_Intensity=0.05              ; Range: 0.03-0.10
```

- **Lower values** = Darker (more challenging)
- **Higher values** = Brighter (easier to see)

### Fog Density

```ini
[AtmosphericEffects]
VolumetricFog_Density=0.15    ; Range: 0.05-0.30
```

### Headlight Brightness

**‚ö†Ô∏è Not recommended to change, but possible:**

```ini
[CarHeadlights]
Headlight_Brightness=1.0    ; Keep at 1.0 for best experience
Headlight_Range=3000.0      ; Increase for wider light cone
```

## Gameplay Tips

1. **Use headlights strategically** - Your car orientation now affects visibility
2. **Boost management** - Boost trails create additional light, plan accordingly
3. **Team coordination** - Stay closer to teammates to share lighting
4. **Positioning awareness** - Learn to play with limited vision
5. **Goal orientation** - Use illuminated goal posts as reference points

## Troubleshooting

### Mod not loading
- Verify files are in the correct directory
- Ensure Rocket League is fully closed before installing
- Check file permissions (should not be read-only)

### Too dark to play
- Adjust `DirectionalLight_Main_Brightness` to 0.20 or 0.25
- Increase `AmbientLight_Intensity` to 0.08
- Reduce `VolumetricFog_Density` to 0.10

### Performance issues
- Lower `ShadowQuality` from `High` to `Medium`
- Disable `VolumetricFog_Enabled`
- Set `DynamicShadows_Enabled=False`

### Headlights not working
- Verify your car has headlights enabled in customization
- Some car bodies don't have visible headlights
- Try a different car (Octane, Dominus recommended)

‚úÖ Custom car skins and decals
