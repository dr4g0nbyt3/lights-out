## Troubleshooting

### Scripts

#### "Rocket League directory not found"
**Cause:** The script cannot locate your Rocket League save directory.

**Solutions:**
1. Launch Rocket League at least once to create the save directory
2. Verify the path exists: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Rocket League\TAGame\CookedPCConsole`
3. If using a custom path, edit the BAT file and change the `RL_DIR` variable

---

#### "Failed to copy files"
**Cause:** Permission issues or files are in use.

**Solutions:**
1. Close Rocket League completely
2. Run the script as Administrator (right-click ‚Üí "Run as administrator")
3. Check that the mod files are in the same directory as the script

---

#### Script doesn't run / Windows blocks it
**Cause:** Windows security blocking unsigned scripts.

**Solutions:**
1. Right-click the .bat file ‚Üí Properties
2. Check "Unblock" at the bottom
3. Click Apply ‚Üí OK
4. Try running again

---

### BakkesMod Commands

#### "lightsout.cfg not found"
**Cause:** The config file is not in the correct location.

**Solution:**
```
Ensure lightsout.cfg is in: %APPDATA%\bakkesmod\bakkesmod\cfg\
Full path example: C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Roaming\bakkesmod\bakkesmod\cfg\lightsout.cfg
```

---

#### Commands do nothing
**Cause:** Config not loaded or BakkesMod not running.

**Solutions:**
1. Press `F6` to open console
2. Type: `exec lightsout.cfg`
3. Verify BakkesMod is running (should see overlay)
4. Try typing the command again

---

#### "Command not recognized"
**Cause:** Config file not loaded or typo in command.

**Solutions:**
1. Load the config: `exec lightsout.cfg`
2. Check command spelling: `lightsout_help`
3. Verify the config file syntax (no syntax errors)

## Advanced Usage

### Customizing the Scripts

You can edit the `.bat` files to change behavior.

**Common Modifications:**

#### Change Rocket League Directory
Edit this line in the script:
```batch
set "RL_DIR=%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\Rocket League\TAGame\CookedPCConsole"
```

Example for custom location:
```batch
set "RL_DIR=D:\Games\RocketLeague\TAGame\CookedPCConsole"
```

---

#### Disable Backups
Comment out backup sections by adding `REM` at the start of lines:
```batch
REM if exist "%RL_DIR%\LightsOut.upk" (
REM     echo Backing up existing LightsOut.upk...
REM     copy /Y "%RL_DIR%\LightsOut.upk" "%BACKUP_DIR%\LightsOut.upk.backup"
REM )
```

---

#### Silent Installation (No Pause)
Remove the `pause` command at the end:
```batch
REM pause
```

```

alias lightsout_normal "lightsout_uninstall; cl_bloom_scale 1.0; echo Normal mode activated!"
```

### Running Scripts from Command Line

You can run the scripts with parameters (requires modification of the scripts).

**Current usage:**
```batch

```

**Silent installation (no pause):**
Add `/silent` parameter support by editing the script:

)
pause
:skipPause
```

Then run:
```batch
install_lightsout.bat /silent
```
