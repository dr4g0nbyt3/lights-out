- You are in **Freeplay mode**
- Plugin is properly loaded via BakkesMod
- You have executed `lightsout_enable` command
- Game is not minimized or in loading screen
- BakkesMod is running in the background

### ‚ùå Plugin WILL NOT Work When:

## Customization Options

### Adjust Bloom Intensity
Default is 3.0, but you can customize:

```
lightsout_bloom 2.5   // Subtle enhancement
lightsout_bloom 3.0   // Default (recommended)
lightsout_bloom 4.0   // Maximum glow effect
```

Then re-apply with: `lightsout_enable`

### Check Current Status
```
lightsout_enabled   // Check if mode is active (1 = on, 0 = off)
```

### Disable Lights Out
```
lightsout_disable   // Restore normal visuals
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Nothing happens when I type lightsout_enable"

**Problem:** Plugin not loaded or wrong game mode

**Solutions:**
1. Verify you're in Freeplay mode (not any other mode)
2. Check plugin is loaded: `plugin list`
3. If not loaded, type: `plugin load lightsout`
4. Try typing the command again: `lightsout_enable`

### "Command not found"

**Problem:** Plugin DLL is not in the correct location

**Solutions:**
1. Press `Win + R`, type: `%APPDATA%\bakkesmod\bakkesmod\plugins\`
2. Verify `LightsOut.dll` exists in this folder
3. Restart Rocket League
4. Load plugin manually: `plugin load lightsout`

### "Visuals don't look different"

**Problem:** Video settings or plugin settings conflict

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure Light Shafts are **OFF** in video settings (critical!)
2. Enable Bloom in video settings
3. Exit and re-enter Freeplay mode
4. Try disabling and re-enabling:
   ```
   lightsout_disable
   lightsout_enable
   ```

### "Plugin worked before but stopped working"

**Problem:** Game mode changed or plugin unloaded

**Solutions:**
1. Make sure you're still in Freeplay mode
2. Check if plugin is still loaded: `plugin list`
3. Reload if needed: `plugin load lightsout`
4. Re-enable: `lightsout_enable`

### "Game performance is worse"

**Problem:** Enhanced visual settings use more GPU

**Solutions:**
1. Lower other video settings (Render Quality, Anti-Aliasing)
2. Reduce bloom intensity: `lightsout_bloom 1.5`
3. Disable Ambient Occlusion if needed
4. Use `lightsout_disable` if performance is critical

---

## Auto-Enable Feature (Optional)

To automatically enable Lights Out whenever you enter Freeplay:

**Step 1:** Navigate to BakkesMod config folder
```
%APPDATA%\bakkesmod\bakkesmod\cfg\
```

**Step 2:** Create or edit `autoexec.cfg`

**Step 3:** Add these lines:
```
plugin load lightsout
// lightsout_enable will auto-run when entering freeplay
```

**Note:** Due to the `PLUGINTYPE_FREEPLAY` restriction, the plugin will only activate when you're in the correct game mode, so auto-enabling is safe.

**Q: Can I use this in online matches?**
**A:** No, the plugin is hard-coded to only work in Freeplay mode (PLUGINTYPE_FREEPLAY restriction).

**Q: Will this give me an advantage?**
**A:** No, because it only works in Freeplay (training), not in competitive modes.

**Q: Can I modify the plugin to work in online matches?**
**A:** Technically yes by changing the plugin type, but this may violate Psyonix TOS and could result in a ban. Not recommended.

**Q: Does this work with other BakkesMod plugins?**
**A:** Yes, this plugin is compatible with most other BakkesMod plugins as it only modifies visual CVars.

**Q: What if I want darker/lighter visuals?**
**A:** Adjust the bloom value: `lightsout_bloom X` (where X is 0.5-5.0)

**Q: Can I bind this to a key?**
**A:** Yes! Add to your BakkesMod config:
```
bind F9 "lightsout_enable"
bind F10 "lightsout_disable"
